# 42-Sommelier
An introductory machine learning project that I wrote for the 42 curriculum.

# Overview

In this project:
* Students implement a perceptron and ADALINE from scratch
* Gain experience working with pandas and plotting/visualizing data with matplotlib
* Reimplement train-test split and k-fold cross-validation functions

Bonuses for this project include:
* Implementing perceptron and ADALINE functions in Cython
* Working with matplotlib to create animations of decision boundaries changing over time
* Creating 3D matplotlib plots to visualize multi-dimensional factor decision boundaries
